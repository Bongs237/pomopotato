# pomopotato

A minimalistic timer built with Next.js. It allows you to set a timer for a specific amount of time and lock in 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️😩😩😔😔🔥🔥🔥🔥

It's based on the "pomodoro timer" technique where you work for a set amount of time, and then take a break for another certain amount of time, so you get time to relax, recharge, and touch some grass. Because you need it. 🦗
